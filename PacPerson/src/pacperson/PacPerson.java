 * The goal of the game is to collect all the points in the maze and avoid the ghosts. 
 * The Pacman is animated in two ways: his position in the maze and his body. We animate 
 * his body with four images, depending on the direction. The animation is used to create 
 * the illusion of Pacman opening and closing his mouth. The maze consists of 15x15 squares. 
 * The structure of the maze is based on a simple array of integers. Pacman has three lives. 
 * We also count the score.
